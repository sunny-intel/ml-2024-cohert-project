The course offered to implement one of the following two projects

1. [Recognize faces in the wild](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild/data)
2. [Wikipedia Image/Caption Matching](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/wikipedia-image-caption/overview)

I chose to implement the second project.
